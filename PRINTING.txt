Another method to include your own True Type fonts is to do the following:
1. Ensure that the True Type font support Unicode.

2. If you purchased True Type fonts from a third-party vendor, ensure that loading the fonts onto yo
the fonts with i5/OS and your HP PCL-capable laser printers does not break any license agreement tha
from that third-party vendor.

3. Copy the *.ttf files for your True Type fonts to the /QIBM/UserData/OS400/Fonts/TTFonts directory

4. Use the following Delete User Index (DLTUSRIDX) command to delete the QGSTTFIDX user index, or *U
library QUSRSYS.

DLTUSRIDX USRIDX(QUSRSYS/QGSTTFIDX)

Note: i5/OS should automatically re-create the QGSTTFIDX user index to include both the True Type fo
/QIBM/ProdData/OS400/Fonts/TTFonts directory that are supplied by Option 43 (Additional Fonts) and t
True Type fonts that you have loaded into the /QIBM/UserData/OS400/Fonts/TTFonts directory.

5. Generate a spooled file that has the Printer device type (DEVTYPE) parameter set to *AFPDS and us
(FONTNAME) DDS keyword to specify the name of the True Type fonts that you have loaded into the IFS,
file to your HP PCL-capable laser printers, and verify that the True Type fonts print when using Hos
(HPT).
