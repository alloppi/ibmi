Change Data Queue - Help
:P.
The Change Data Queue (CHGDTAQ) command changes allows you to change
a subset of data queue attributes for the data queue specified.
:P.
When changing a data queue, a shared update lock will be used.  If the
lock cannot be obtained, CPF9803 (Cannot allocate object in library) is
generated.  If any job is using the dequeue (DEQ) MI instruction with a
wait value or the Receive Data Queue (QRCVDTAQ) API with a wait value
while removing the entry, CPF9503 (Cannot lock data queue) is generated
and the request would need to be tried again when the queue is
available.
:P.
After the attribute is changed, the new value will be used
for subsequent data queue operations.  For example, if the Allocate
Object (ALCOBJ) CL command was used to lock a data queue while locks
are being enforced, when the data queue is changed to ignore locks, no
exception is issued.  All data queue operations waiting for a lock on
the queue at the time of the change will remain waiting until they get
the lock or until they timeout with the CPF9503.  Any subsequent data
queue operations will no longer perform locking for the queue, so the
lock via ALCOBJ is ignored by data queue operations.

Release V6R1M0 is required to run this command.
:LI.
This command cannot be used to change a DDM data queue.
:LI.
To change a data queue a shared for update (*SHRUPD) lock is required.
:EUL.
:P.
:NT.
There is a possibility of a permanent deadlock when you use this command
to change the data queue attributes to enforce data queue locking. If
the enforce data queue locking option is turned on, and a thread gets
an exclusive thread scoped lock on the queue with the Allocate Object
(ALCOBJ) CL command, and then it performs a receive (or dequeue) with a
wait and there are no messages that satisfy the receive (or dequeue),
then the thread will enter a permanent deadlock waiting for a message.
:P.
This is a permanent deadlock because no other thread or job will be
able to get in to perform a send (or enqueue) because the receive (or
dequeue) thread that is waiting is holding the thread scoped exclusive
lock that was obtained via ALCOBJ. To recover from the deadlock, cancel
the job.

Enforce data queue locks (ENFORCE) - Help

:XH3.Enforce data queue locks (ENFORCE)
:P.
Identifies whether IBM-supplied data queue operations will enforce a
lock on the data queue.  This attribute cannot be specified on the
Create Data Queue (CRTDTAQ) CL command.
:P.
The default when a data queue is created is for locks to be ignored.  A
data queue can be locked with the Allocate Object (ALCOBJ) CL command.
Locks can be viewed with the Work with Object Locks (WRKOBJLCK) CL
command.
:P.
When locks are enforced, performance can be impacted due to the
additional locking performed by all data queue operations.  When data
queue locks are being observed, the following lock will be used for
each data queue operation:
:P.
:UL.
:LI.
*SHRUPD: Clear Data Queue (QCLRDTAQ) API, Receive Data Queue (QRCVDTAQ)
API, Send Data Queue (QSNDDTAQ) API, Enqueue (ENQ) and Dequeue (DEQ) MI
instructions.
:LI.
*SHRRD:  Retrieve Data Queue Description (QMHQRDQD) API, Retrieve Data
Queue Message (QMHRDQM) API, Materialize Queue Attribute (MATQAT) and
Materialize Queue Message (MATQMSG) MI instructions.

locks being enforced.

Locks on the data queue are enforced by IBM-supplied data queue
operations.  This value can impact performance due to the additional
locking performed for all data queue operations.
