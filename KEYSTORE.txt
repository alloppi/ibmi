This is about how to create Cryptography Keystore
Details can refer to IBM i Manual "Security Cryptography"

Hierarchical key system
  Master key store in secure
    Key-encrypting keys (KEKs) - use to encrypt a stored key or sent to another system, KEKs encrypt
      Data keys - encrypt user data and encryted under a KEK or a master key

Managing master keys
  4 operations: load -> set, test, clear
  Contains a key verification value (KVV). The KVV is a 20-byte hash of key value
  - ADDMSTPART: Add Master Key Part command can load a master key to a new version
  - SETMSTKEY : Set Master Key command to set the specified master key that has added by ADDMSTPART
  - CHKMSTKVV : Check Master KVV command to test a specified master key and version
  - CLRMSTKEY : Clear Master Key command to clear the specified master key

Managing cryptographic keystore files
  We can create keystore files, and add, generate, delete, import, export, and retrieve attributes f
  - CRTCKMKSF : Create Keystore File command to create a new database file for storing cryptographic
  - ADDCKMKSFE: Add Keystore File Entry command to add a key record with the specified clear key val
  - GENCKMKSFE: Or use the Generate Keystore File Entry  command to generate a random key or key pai
  - DSPCKMKSFE: Display Keystore File Entry command to display the attributes of a keystore file rec
