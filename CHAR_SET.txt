UTF-8 is an encoding - Unicode is a character set
-------------------------------------------------
A character set is a list of characters with unique numbers (these numbers are sometimes referred to
For example, in the Unicode character set, the number for A is 41.

An encoding on the other hand, is an algorithm that translates a list of numbers to binary so it can
For example UTF-8 would translate the number sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 like this:
00000001 00000010 00000011 00000100

Our data is now translated into binary and can now be saved to disk.

All together now
----------------
Say an application reads the following from the disk:
1101000 1100101 1101100 1101100 1101111

The app knows this data represent a Unicode string encoded with UTF-8 and must show this as text to
is to convert the binary data to numbers. The app uses the UTF-8 algorithm to decode the data. In th
returns this:

104 101 108 108 111

Since the app knows this is a Unicode string, it can assume each number represents a character. We u
character set to translate each number to a corresponding character. The resulting string is "hello"

Conclusion

So when somebody asks you "What is the difference between UTF-8 and Unicode?", you can now confident
precise:

UTF-8 and Unicode cannot be compared. UTF-8 is an encoding used to translate numbers into binary dat
character set used to translate characters into numbers.
